## Demo

A demo with feature images is available in the repository [jonathanjanssens/hugo-casper3-demo](https://github.com/jonathanjanssens/hugo-casper3-demo).

## Installation

```$ mkdir themes
$ cd themes
$ git clone git@github.com:jonathanjanssens/hugo-casper3.git
```

Either set the theme in your config to `casper3` or build with the `-t casper3` flag.

## Using the theme

This theme is very image heavy so it is recommended to set a `feature_image` parameter in the front matter of any content.

Posts should be created under the 'post' content type, e.g. `hugo new post/example-post.md`.

## Supported Hugo Versions

The theme has been tested and is working with these versions of Hugo. It should work with others, but if you want to add another officially supported version give it a test and make a pull request to update this.

- 0.55.5

## Development Roadmap

[] Use SCSS from original theme instead of compiled CSS - also needs Hugo Pipes setting up
[] Multi author support and author taxonomy

## Support

It would be nice if you leave the credit to me in the footer, unless you make a donation to show support. I can't really police this though, it's MIT licensed anyway so you can do whatever you want with the theme...

If you would like to show your appreciation to me for working on this theme you can <a href="https://paypal.me/JonathanJanssens">donate with Paypal</a> here.
